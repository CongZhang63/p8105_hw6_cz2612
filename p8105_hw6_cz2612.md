This is my solution to Homework 6.

## Problem 1

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("data/homicide-data.csv", na = c("", "NA", "Unknown")) %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "),
    victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age),
    resolution = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ 0,
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ 0,
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ 1)
  ) %>% 
  filter(
    victim_race %in% c("White", "Black"),
    city_state != "Tulsa, AL") %>% 
  select(city_state, resolution, victim_age, victim_race, victim_sex)
```

Start with one city.

``` r
baltimore_df =
  homicide_df %>% 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD")

glm(resolution ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, 
    data = baltimore_df,
    family = binomial()) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  mutate(
    OR = exp(estimate),
    CI_lower = exp(estimate - 1.96 * std.error),
    CI_upper = exp(estimate + 1.96 * std.error)
  ) %>% 
  select(term, OR, starts_with("CI")) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

| term              |    OR | CI\_lower | CI\_upper |
| :---------------- | ----: | --------: | --------: |
| (Intercept)       | 1.363 |     0.975 |     1.907 |
| victim\_age       | 0.993 |     0.987 |     1.000 |
| victim\_raceWhite | 2.320 |     1.648 |     3.268 |
| victim\_sexMale   | 0.426 |     0.325 |     0.558 |

Try this across cities.

``` r
models_results_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  nest(data = -city_state) %>% 
  mutate(
    models = 
      map(.x = data, ~glm(resolution ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, data = .x, family = binomial())),
    results = map(models, broom::tidy)
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, results) %>% 
  unnest(results) %>% 
  mutate(
    OR = exp(estimate),
    CI_lower = exp(estimate - 1.96 * std.error),
    CI_upper = exp(estimate + 1.96 * std.error)
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, term, OR, starts_with("CI")) 
```

``` r
models_results_df %>% 
  filter(term == "victim_sexMale") %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, OR)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = OR)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = CI_lower, ymax = CI_upper)) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```

## Problem 2

#### Load and clean the data for regression analysis.

``` r
baby_df = 
  read_csv("./data/birthweight.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    babysex = factor(babysex),
    babysex = fct_recode(babysex, male = "1", female = "2"),
    frace = factor(frace),
    frace = fct_recode(frace, white = "1", black = "2", asian = "3", puerto_rican = "4", other = "8"),
    malform = factor(malform),
    malform = fct_recode(malform, absent = "0", present = "1"),
    mrace = factor(mrace),
    mrace = fct_recode(mrace, white = "1", black = "2", asian = "3", puerto_rican = "4"),
    delwt = delwt * 453.59237,
    ppwt = ppwt * 453.59237,
    wtgain = wtgain * 453.59237
  )

sum(is.na(baby_df))
```

    ## [1] 0

The resulting dataset `baby_df` contains the following 20 variables:
babysex, bhead, blength, bwt, delwt, fincome, frace, gaweeks, malform,
menarche, mheight, momage, mrace, parity, pnumlbw, pnumsga, ppbmi, ppwt,
smoken, wtgain. This dataset has 4342 observations and 0 missing value.
Numeric variables `babysex`, `frace`, `malform`, and `mrace` have been
converted into factor variables. The units of variables `delwt`, `ppwt`
and `wtgain` have been converted from pounds to grams for further
analyses.

#### Propose a regression model for birthweight.

``` r
step_mod = step(lm(bwt ~., data = baby_df), direction = 'both', trace = FALSE)

summary(step_mod)
```

Stepwise algorithm, with AIC being the criteria, has been used to find
the suitable regression model for birthweight. Finally, we have the
optimal regression model: `bwt ~ babysex + bhead + blength + delwt +
fincome + gaweeks + mheight + mrace + parity + ppwt + smoken`. The
multiple r-squared is 0.7181, and adjusted r-squared is 0.7173. The p
value is smaller than 2.2e-16.

#### Show a plot of model residuals against fitted values.

``` r
baby_df %>% 
  add_predictions(step_mod) %>% 
  add_residuals(step_mod) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = pred, y = resid)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "red", se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Fitted Values vs. Model Residuals",
       x = "Fitted Values", 
       y = "Model Residuals",
       caption = "Data from Child’s Birthweight Dataset")
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using formula 'y ~ x'

<img src="p8105_hw6_cz2612_files/figure-gfm/residuals fitted values plot-1.png" width="90%" />

From the graph, we could see a big cluster of points. In the right side
where fitted values are large, the model residuals tend to evenly
distributed around 0. In the left side where fitted values are small,
most model residuals are positive and some some model residuals a far
greater than 0.

#### Compare my model to two others.

``` r
cv_df = 
  crossv_mc(baby_df, 100) %>% 
  mutate(
    train = map(train, as_tibble),
    test = map(test, as_tibble)
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    model_1 = map(.x = train, ~lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks, data = .x)),
    model_2 = map(.x = train, ~lm(bwt ~ bhead * blength * babysex, data = .x)),
    model_step = map(.x = train, ~lm(bwt ~ babysex + bhead + blength + delwt + fincome + gaweeks + mheight + mrace + parity + ppwt + smoken, data = .x))
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    rmse_model_1 = map2_dbl(.x = model_1, .y = test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)),
    rmse_model_2 = map2_dbl(.x = model_2, .y = test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)),
    rmse_model_step = map2_dbl(.x = model_step, .y = test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y))
  )


cv_df %>% 
  select(starts_with("rmse")) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    everything(),
    names_to = "model",
    values_to = "rmse",
    names_prefix = "rmse_"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(model = fct_reorder(model,rmse)) %>%   
  ggplot(aes(x = model, y = rmse, fill = model)) +
  geom_violin() +
  labs(title = "Cross Validation Comparisons",
       x = "Model",
       y = "RMSE",
       caption = "Data from Child’s Birthweight Dataset")
```

<img src="p8105_hw6_cz2612_files/figure-gfm/cross validation comparisons-1.png" width="90%" />

From the violin plot, we could see that my model `rmse_model_step` (bwt
\~ babysex + bhead + blength + delwt + fincome + gaweeks + mheight +
mrace + parity + ppwt + smoken) has lower RMSE than the other two
models: `model_1` (bwt \~ blength + gaweeks) and `model_2` (bwt \~ bhead
\* blength \* babysex). Therefore, `rmse_model_step` has the best
performance among these three models, and `model_1` with main effect
only has the worst performance among all three models.
